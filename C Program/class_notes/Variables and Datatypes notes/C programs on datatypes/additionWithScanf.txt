	//r, u both are local variables as we can declared them inside  function
	int r;  //variable declaration   //r stores number values so declaring r as a int type

    scanf("%d %d",&r,&u);     //here we are enter 2 values on console one is stored inside r variable and second is stored inside u variable. So using &r, &u
	
	int  d =r+u; //here d is a variable that stores the addition of r and u
				//similary you can do subtraction, multiplication, division only by changing symbols like r-u,r*u,r/u

	printf("\naddition = %d" , d); //to print the result on command prompt we use printf() fuction which is define inside stdio.h header fiel
	  							//while printing the result of something on command prompt we need to mention format specifier in printf function
	  							 // %d format specifier is used to print integer/number values
	
}
//output
//Enter 2 numbers for addition : 30  5

//addition = 35
